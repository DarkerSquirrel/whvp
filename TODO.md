# TODO

- use fnv::FnvHashMap when possible
- kill mspc, just use crossbeam
- use AsRef<Path> for functions taking path as parameters
- change proto of mutate_input
- remove ni_rs internally (need to rewrite it)
- integrate a Strategy to handle traces with memory access (similar to grimoire and redqueen)
- rethink fuzzer architecture
